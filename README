VM environment for the MOOCBD labs

Documentation
-------------
The purpose of this project is to create a virtual environment built
with Vagrant and run by VirtualBox for labs of a MOOC on Relational
Databases developped at Telecom SudParis [0].

Vagrant basic version
---------------------
The 'VagrantBox/' subdir contains the 'Vagrantfile' and associate
provisioning scripts necessary to create the labs VM/Box.

See VagrantBox/manuel.[org|html] for more docs (in french), which is
also available at: https://fusionforge.int-evry.fr/www/moocbdvm/

Development
-----------
The hosting project is at
https://fusionforge.int-evry.fr/projects/moocbdvm/

The project's Git repository is available at
https://fusionforge.int-evry.fr/scm/?group_id=63

Docker experimental version
---------------------------
The docker/ subdir contains an experimental setup using Vagrant and
Docker, relying on the docker provider for Vagrant.

Attention: the line endings are important for scripts run inside
docker so the .gitattributes forces Windows to not convert to DOS
endings at checkout time.
