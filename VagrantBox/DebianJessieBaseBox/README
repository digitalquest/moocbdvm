Debian Jessie base box, up to date
----------------------------------

This directory contains the bits needed to create an up-to-date base
box containing a Debian Jessie installation, updated to latest
versions of the packages.

Such a box, can be used as a base box for the rest of the developments.


The process is the following :

 - create the .box package : make

 - add the box : vagrant box add --name debianjessiebase debianjessiebase-YYYYMMDDHHMM.box

 - use if as a base box for further VM construction

Tested with Vagrant 1.6.3 (upstream provided Debian packages)
